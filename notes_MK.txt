This is a test text file. I will use it to write down notes. 


(Git) Commands:
touch <filename.filetype> creates a new file
vim <filename.tiletype> lets me change the file in a text editor; start writing with "i", exit and save by "esc",":x"
git status checks the status
git add . to add untracked files
git add <filename.filetype> everytime before commit 
git commit -m "..." to comment changes
git log gives you the changes that happened so far to a file
git push -u origin master says where it is pushed to, -u etc will be stored so push sufficient in later uploads (username & PW)
git remote add origin https://github.com/.../... in case master has still to be identified (enter PW)

git pull -u origin master (-u can be left out) will pull all contents of current repo
